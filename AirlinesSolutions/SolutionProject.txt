A-Find list of airports operating in Country India
hadoop jar /home/edureka/Desktop/AirlinesSolution.jar in.edureka.airlines.IndiaOperatingAirports  airports_mod.dat  outIndiaOperatingAirports
result_file: outIndiaOperatingAirports_part-r-00000

B- FInd the listof airlines having zero stops
hadoop jar /home/edureka/Desktop/AirlinesSolution.jar in.edureka.airlines.ZeroStopsAirlinesRJ routes airlines  outZeroStopsAirlines
result_file: outZeroStopsAirlines_part-r-00000

C- List of airlines operating with CodeShare

FOR THIS I DID THE FOLLOWING PIG CODE with i executed in grunt shell


airlines = LOAD '/home/edureka/Desktop/Final_airlines' using PigStorage(',') as (id: int, name: chararray,  alias:chararray, iata:chararray, icao: chararray, callsign:chararray, country:chararray);
routes = LOAD '/home/edureka/Desktop/routes.dat' using  PigStorage(',') as (airline: chararray, airline_id: int,  source_airport:chararray, source_airport_id:int, destination_airport:chararray, destination_airport_id: int,
codeshare:chararray, stops:chararray, equipment:chararray);
filtered = FILTER routes BY codeshare=='Y';
joined= JOIN filtered BY airline_id, airlines BY id;
by_airline_name =  GROUP joined by name;
names_repeated = FOREACH by_airline_name GENERATE joined.name;
flattened = FOREACH by_airline_name GENERATE FLATTEN(joined.name);
tupled = DISTINCT flattened;
ordered = ORDER tupled by name;
STORE ordered INTO 'codeshare_airlines';


result file:
part-r-00000_codeshare


D- Wich country or territory having highest airports:

I had difficulty understanding the problem as is formulated.

So my interpretation is which country has the biggest sum of airports altitude (highest), which is United States


In my jar i have a map reduce class for that (HighestAirportsCountryPartitioner). 
But i like the following PIG Code better:

airports = LOAD '/home/edureka/Desktop/airports_mod.dat' using PigStorage(',') as
(id: int, name: chararray,  city:chararray, country:chararray, faa: chararray, iata:chararray, latitude:chararray, longitude:chararray, altitude:int,  timezone:chararray, dst:chararray, tz:chararray);
byname = GROUP airports by country;
sum = FOREACH byname generate  group, SUM(airports.altitude) ;	
sorted = ORDER sum by $1 DESC;
highest_airports_country = LIMIT sorted 1;
dump highest_airports_country;
STORE highest_airports_country INTO 'highest_airports_country';


result file: 
part-r-00000_highestAirports

E: FIND LIST OF ACTIVE AIRLINES IN US

I calculate based on routes file, and if corresponding airline is in US , then i output it

hadoop jar /home/edureka/Desktop/AirlinesSolution.jar in.edureka.airlines.USActiveAirlines routes airlines  outUSActiveAirlines

result_file:outUSActiveAirlines_part-r-00000
